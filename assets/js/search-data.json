A late or missed assignment or quiz is simply missed, unless you have a doctor-certified illness on the day of the deadline that prevents you from submitting. In this scenario, contact the professor no later than 48 hours after the due date and attach the supporting documentation described; otherwise, your case will be dismissed. A submission is considered on time if it is submitted electronically on Gradescope on or before the required submission date/time. Once the submission link is closed, it will not be reopened, and email submissions are not accepted. Each assignment has a specific link for submission, so you must ensure that the correct files are submitted to the corresponding link. For example, if Homework 1 is submitted via the Homework 2 link, it will be marked as an “incorrect submission”, and a grade of 0 will be assigned. You can avoid this by taking a few extra minutes to review your submission after uploading it. It is the responsibility of the student to verify that the files are correct. Please note that resubmissions are not accepted due to wrong file submissions or files that can’t be open. Waiting until the last minute may result in submission errors or failure to submit altogether. Please note that network connection failures or instability will not be accepted as an excuse for late or missed submissions, as there is ample time provided for submission. Submissions via unofficial channels—such as email, chat, or Canvas—will not be accepted or graded. Late Policy . Late submissions will incur a 10% deduction per day unless otherwise noted. Each homework and project allows up to 2 late days maximum. After that, the Gradescope link will be closed, and no further submission will be accepted. Academic Integrity . While conceptual collaboration is encouraged, all submitted homework must be your own. For programming projects, groups of up to 4 students are permitted. Ensure all contributions are clearly documented. ",
